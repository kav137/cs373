# -----------
# User Instructions:
#
# Modify the the search function so that it returns
# a shortest path as follows:
#
# [['>', 'v', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' '],
#  [' ', '>', '>', '>', '>', 'v'],
#  [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'v'],
#  [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', 'v'],
#  [' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', '*']]
#
# Where '>', '<', '^', and 'v' refer to right, left,
# up, and down motions. Note that the 'v' should be
# lowercase. '*' should mark the goal cell.
#
# You may assume that all test cases for this function
# will have a path from init to goal.
# ----------

# KAV: this algorithm uses start -> end tactics, but in the course it was said
# that we have to first find our goal memorizing our actions along the way
# and only afterwards build a plan using reverse sequence of steps aka 'end -> start'
